# WordPress plugin for planning events

A WordPress plugin that allows you to create a frontend-editable table for event planning, aimed at churches to plan their services.

## Installation

Download this repository as a zip and copy the unzipped folder to the plugins directory of your WordPress site.
This plugin uses icons provided by FontAwesome and relies on the site to provide those, so if your theme does not contain FontAwesome, you need to install a plugin (e.g. https://de.wordpress.org/plugins/better-font-awesome/).

## Development

1. Run `npm install`
2. To start developing, run `npm run dev`
3. For production build, run `npm run build`


## Tests

[Testcafe](https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/) is used for testing. Run the tests with `npm run test`.
This assumes you have a WordPress instance running on port 8000, with two example pages set up (test-event-planner & test-event-planner-static).

## Built with

[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and the [WordPress Vue.js starter plugin](https://github.com/tareq1988/vue-wp-starter) by [Tareq Hasan](https://github.com/tareq1988).
